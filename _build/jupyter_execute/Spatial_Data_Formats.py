# Spatial Data Formats
# --------------------
# 
# There are several data spatial data models that you may encounter as you
# work with geo data. Geodata formats are commonly divided into two types,
# vector data or a raster data. In GIS, discrete data means that the data
# has a fixed location. Continuous data in GIS does not have well defined
# or no boundary at all, the most common example is elevation. The graphic
# below shows how vector data and raster data formats can represent
# continuous or discrete data:

# The graphic also illustrates how certain vector data is often better
# suited for discrete data, while raster data is often better used for
# continuous data. Let's go into a little more detail about each!
