# ### Raster Data
# 
# Raster data represents continuous fields or discrete objects on a grid,
# storing measurements or category names in each cell of the grid.
# 
# Digital photos are raster data you are already familiar with. If you
# zoom in far enough on a digital photo, you\'ll see that photo is made up
# of pixels, which appear as colored squares. Pixels are cells in a
# regular grid and each contains the digital code that corresponds to the
# color that should be displayed there.
# 
# You may be surprised to see jpgs listed as a data type that you may have
# thought to be non-spatial, but satellite imagery is commonly stored in
# photo formats.
