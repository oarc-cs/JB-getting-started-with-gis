# ### Vector Data
# 
# Vector data represents discrete objects in the real world with points,
# lines, and polygons in the dataset.
# 
# If you were to draw a map to your house for a friend, you would
# typically use vector data - roads would be lines, a shopping center
# included as an important landmark might be a rectangle of sorts, and
# your house might be a point (perhaps represented by a star or a house
# icon).
