# Introduction to GIS for the Social Sciences
# -------------------------------------------
# 
# Now that we have a good understanding of geospatial data, we can explore
# the GIS connection to the social sciences.
# 
# Geography is divided into physical geography (natural systems) and human
# geography (human-made systems). The social sciences sit within
# human-made systems and the data here is often captured in specific
# units. Such as number of people living in a specific city or the
# language spoken in a country. Most of the data we will encounter
# will be discrete.

# The following election result map shows the number of people from each state that voted for either Biden or Trump in the 2020 general election.

# The states themselves are the boundaries, even though the data is
# collected at smaller levels.
# 
# How is that possible?
